# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 9

Welcome to Spark in Action, 2e, chapter 9. This chapter covers advanced ingestion, including writing your own custom data source with Java.

## Lab

Each chapter has one or more labs. Labs are examples used for teaching in the book(https://www.manning.com/books/spark-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=jgp). You are encouraged to take ownership of the code and modify it, experiment with it, hence the use of the term **lab**. This chapter has only one lab.

### Lab \#100

The `PhotoMetadataIngestionApp` application does the following:

1.	It acquires a session (a `SparkSession`).
2.	It asks Spark to load (ingest) a dataset in 'exif' format.
3.	Spark stores the contents in a dataframe, then print the records.

## Running the lab in Java

For information on running the Java lab, see chapter 1 in [Spark in Action, 2nd edition](http://jgp.net/sia).


## Running the lab in Scala

Prerequisites:

You will need:
 * `git`.
 * Apache Spark (please refer Appendix P - "Spark in production: installation and a few tips"). 

1. Clone this project

    git clone https://github.com/jgperrin/net.jgp.books.spark.ch09

2. cd net.jgp.books.spark.ch09

3. Package application using sbt command

   ```
     sbt clean assembly
   ```

4. Run Spark/Scala application using spark-submit command as shown below:

   ```
   spark-submit --class net.jgp.books.spark.ch09.lab100_photo_datasource.PhotoMetadataIngestionScalaApp target/scala-2.12/SparkInAction2-Chapter09-assembly-1.0.0.jar  
   ```

Notes: 
 1. [Java] Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10 (published in April 2019).
 2. [Scala, Python] As of MEAP v14, we have introduced Scala and Python examples (published in October 2019).
